***Hint: If the gaze tracker isn't very accurate, you will want to re-train it with a few more training samples. To capture a new sample, focus on your cursor with your eyes, and hit the right Alt key. After you've captured a bunch of samples, press the 'Start Training' button again to re-train the neural network***
